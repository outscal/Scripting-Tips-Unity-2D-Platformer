## Unity: Entity Component System (ECS)

Unity supports the C# programming language natively. C# (pronounced C-sharp) is an industry-standard language similar to Java or C++.

The behaviour of the GameObjects is controlled by the Components that are attached to them. Unity’s built-in Components can be very versatile, you will soon realize you need to go beyond what they can provide to implement your own gameplay features. Unity allows you to create your own Components using scripts. These allow you to trigger game events, modify Component properties over time and respond to user input in any way you like.
